One of the most prestigious international sporting events is the modern Olympic Games, also called the Olympics. A wide range of sports are held there throughout the year, and competitors from across the globe participate.

Pandas is a flexible, strong, and user-friendly open source program for data analysis and manipulation.
NumPy is a Python package for processing arrays.
A full set of functions for producing static, animated, and interactive visualizations are available in the Python library Matplotlib.
Python statistical graphics plots are visualized using the Seaborn package.
